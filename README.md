# ns3ieee

A simple ns3(3.26) application which simulates a IEEE 802.11 (5 GHz) network with a single Acess Point (AP node) and two Station Points(STA nodes) located at distances allocated by us and generates the .pcap and .tr traces with the help of pcap tracing and Ascii trace helpers. 

Statistics can be observed by using wireshark to open the .pcap files or tracegraph to open .tr files or also by writing scripts that capture details in these trace files.
